# MedCheck

## Description 

As an elderly user, I want to track my prescriptions, medications and doctor appointments so that all this information is in one progressive mobile application.

### Motivation:

We  understand  that  many  of  us  require  numerous  medications as we get older. Often we are also caring for elderly parents and relatives who have  multiple  medical  conditions and doctors. Both, families and ailing patients,  can struggle to keep all this information  in  one  easily  accessible space â€“ a mobile phone. 

### Future Improvements:
* APIs
    * Medicatation Interactions
    * Doctor Information


## Installation

Here's a link to the deployed app:
